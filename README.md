# Data-Science-R
This covers my journey in learning Data Science using R from a lot of resources on the internet. This is a documentation of the whole process highlighting what I learn, together with practices and tutorials.
Learning outcomes:
- Understand the R programming language and its ecosystem of packages for data science
- Obtain and clean data before processing
- Master essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data
- Examine various machine learning prediction models
- Work with interactive visualization packages in R
- Apply data mining techniques to available datasets
- Explore the H2O analytics platform in R for deep learning
- Integrate R with Spark and Hadoop for large-scale data analytics

  By the end, I aim to get geared up to tackle real-life data challenges by analyzing complex datasets. This in turn will bring out insights that companies can convert into actions.
  Software used is R Studio for Windows.
